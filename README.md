Welcome to my professional environment. I am a Cybersecurity Analyst specializing in the intersection of **Technical Security** and **Financial Integrity**.

## 🛡️ THE HYBRID ADVANTAGE

My background in **Accounting and Finance** provides a unique perspective on Cybersecurity:
- **Audit-Ready Mindset:** Applying financial auditing rigor to System Compliance (GRC)
- **Risk Assessment:** Understanding the financial impact of technical vulnerabilities
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring that security measures protect not just the network, but the core business assets

## 🛠️ PROJECT ORION (C++ PORT SCANNER)

**Project Orion** is a professional-grade reconnaissance tool developed in **C++**. It demonstrates my ability to work with low-level networking and high-performance code.

### ⚙️ Technical Highlights
* **Socket API:** Direct implementation of the Berkeley Sockets API.
* **Timeout Management:** Custom `setsockopt` and `struct timeval` for ultra-fast response times.
* **Memory Efficiency:** No external dependencies, ensuring a lightweight footprint.
* **Terminal UX:** Clean CLI output with real-time port status reporting

### 🚀 Usage
```bash
# Compilation
g++ scanner.cpp -o orion -O3

# Execution (Syntax: ./orion <target_ip>)
./orion 192.168.1.1
