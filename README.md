## 🛠️ Project Orion (Port Scanner)

**Project Orion** is a high-performance network port scanner written in C++. It is designed for speed and reliability in auditing network perimeters.

### Features
- **Custom Socket Management:** Uses raw sockets with `setsockopt` for precise control.
- **Non-blocking I/O:** Implements `select()` for custom timeout management (0.5s default).
- **Real-time Feedback:** Terminal UI updates in real-time using carriage return (`\r`) overwriting.
- **Optimization:** Focused scan on Well-Known Ports (1-1024).

### How to Compile & Run

You need a C++ compiler (like g++).

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd project_orion

# Compile the source code
g++ scanner.cpp -o orion

# Run the scanner (requires an IP address)
./orion 127.0.0.1
```
